# Unit.Converter

This is a Unit Converter app made with ASP.NET Core Minimal API. The web app can convert between different units of measurement. It can convert units of length, weight, volume, area, temperature, and more. The user can input a value and select the units to convert from and to. The application will then display the converted value. 

This is a project from: https://roadmap.sh/projects/unit-converter

## Technical Requirements

You must have access to dotnet features, no nuget packages needed.

## How it works

There will be a simple webpage that will have 4 buttons: home, length, weight and temperature, you will submit the form to the server and get the converted value back and display it on the webpage.
